    <p>My name is Yusuke Ho. I was born in Japan and moved to America when I was 1-3 years old. I can speak 3 languages, which include english, japanese, and mandarin.</p>
    <p>In the future I hope to make something important that will improve technology. Some things I hope to one day work on are AI, quantum, or things that are related to the brain.</p>
    <p>When I become an adult I want to to live in a small apartment in Japan where I can work without leaving the house. This is because I am a shut-in and an introvert that hates excercising.</p>
