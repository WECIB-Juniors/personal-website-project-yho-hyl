        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Yusuke Ho. I was born in Japan and moved to America when I was 1-3 years old. I can speak 3 languages, which include english, japanese, and mandarin.</p>
        <p>In the future I hope to make something important that will improve technology. Some things I hope to one day work on are AI, quantum, or things that are related to the brain.</p>
        <p>When I become an adult I want to to live in a small apartment in Japan where I can work without leaving the house. This is because I am a shut-in and an introvert that hates excercising.</p>

    <h1>My Interests</h1>

    <ul>
    <strong><li>Games (with restraints)</li></strong> <p>Games are fun and all, but challenging yourself further by making the game more difficult makes the game better. After completing the challenge the the sense of exhilaration and satisfaction makes the challenge worth completing. The sense of relief, like a weight has been lifted from your sholders makes the suffering caused by the challenge worth completing.</p>
    <strong><li>Games</li></strong> <p>Some games are already challenging on its own. It is fun to play and eases the stress caused by your everyday life.</p>
    <strong><li>Simple Board Games</li></strong> <p>I think that simple games become more difficult the game becomes. For example, you need to predict your opponents move and act accordingly in order to win othelo.</p>
    <strong><li>Tea</li></strong> <p>There are thousands of types of tea that you can enjoy. Tea allows me to calm down and it goes extremely well with sweets.</p>
    <strong><li>Japanese Sweets | 和菓子</li></strong> <p>American sweets are just piles of sugar that have <em>NO</em> essense of sweets, in comparison 和菓子 are made to tase good on its own and better with tea.</p>
